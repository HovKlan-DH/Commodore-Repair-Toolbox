// The "Add new component" path through the contribution editor: the window opened on a component
// that exists nowhere yet, so the contributor names it instead of the board data.
//
// Two things make this worth testing through the real window rather than only through
// ContributionPackaging.ValidateNewComponentBoardLabel:
//
//   1. What gets PRELOADED. The board-wide sections (board local files, board links) are diffed
//      against the server as whole lists, so a new component that came up with them empty would
//      submit a proposal to delete every one of them. The component-scoped sections must be the
//      opposite - empty, and not quietly filled from data rows that carry a blank board label.
//   2. Where the typed label ENDS UP. Rows added before the label is typed are stamped with the
//      board label as it was then, which is nothing, so the payload has to fill them in.
//
// Private members are reached by reflection, the same approach and reasoning as
// ComponentContributionValidationTests: the logic is welded to a Window.
