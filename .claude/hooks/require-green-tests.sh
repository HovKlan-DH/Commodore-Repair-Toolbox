# This enforces rule 3 of .claude/CLAUDE.md ("ALWAYS run dotnet test before
# reporting any code change as done") mechanically, so that it no longer

#
# Behaviour:
#   * Code unchanged since the last green run -> exits silently and instantly.
#   * Code changed -> runs the suite in Release (same as CI, and clear of the
#     bin/Debug lock held while the app is running). Green: records state, exits 0.
#     Red: exits 2, which blocks the handover and feeds the failing tests back
#     to Claude so it has to deal with them.
#   * Already blocked once for this same stop -> warns loudly but does not block
#     again, so a suite the agent cannot fix never traps the session in a loop.
#
# Turn it off temporarily with /hooks, or permanently by deleting the "Stop"
# block from .claude/settings.json.
