Hardware      : Commodore 64
Board(s)      : 250407 + 250425 + 250466 (all "longboards")
Revision date : 2025-December-30
--------------------------------

Below is my default troubleshooting guide for myself, so I do not forget. In most cases it covers the basics only, and it is for sure not a methodotical checklist that will check everything. I will add or change, once I repair more.

There is a slight change between the longboards and the shortboard. In the "longboards" there are two different "rails" for +5VDC - one directly from the external power supply and one from the "CAN".

--------------------
Tooling requirements
--------------------
- Oscilloscope
- Multimeter


---------------------
Very first inspection
---------------------
Do a thorough visual inspection of the board. Check for obvious faults like loose wires or components, components with bent or broken pins, short circuits, oxidation, user modifications or anything else that looks weird.
Many times the board has previously been repaired by someone else, so do check the backside for rework, and if it looks horrible, then it could be a good place to start troubleshooting.
Also do check that IC's are oriented correctly, and that e.g. SID and PLA has not been swapped.


-----------------
Voltages : Step 1
-----------------
Recommended reading for understanding C64 voltages:
https://refurbished-commodore.com/checking-c64-voltages


User port:
    +5VDC between pin 1+2 (one on each side of gap)
    9VAC between pin 10+11 (one on each side of gap)
CPU:
    +5VDC (PSU) pin 6
VIC-II:
    +5VDC (CAN) pin 40
    +12VDC pin 13

Also, traces or components could be broken elsewhere, so it is of course not bullet-proof, and you may need to check other places also, but above gives a good indication if the power rails are in good shape.


-----------------
Voltages : Step 2
-----------------
If any of the above voltages fails or looks off then check these.

Fuse:
    ---> THIS ONE MUST BE DONE WHEN C64 IS OFF!! <---
    In multimeter continuity mode then measure between the two ends - it should beep
Power switch:
    +5VDC between pin 5 and GND when C64 is off (it is expected voltage can be slightly higher due to no load)
    +5VDC between pin 4 and GND when C64 is on
Also check the two power supplies:
    7805:
        +5VDC pin 2 (right-most pin): this is "CAN" source
    7812:
        +12VDC pin 2 (right-most pin)


-----------
Frequencies
-----------
CPU:
    pin 1 = 985 kHz: "Φ0" clock input
    pin 39 = 985 kHz: "Φ2" clock output from CPU
VIC-II:
    pin 17 = 985 kHz: "Φ0" clock output from VIC-II
    pin 21 = 17.72 MHz: ΦCOLOR clock input
    pin 22 = 7.88 MHz: ΦDOT clock input


-------
Signals
-------
Reset:
    CPU:
        pin 40 = at power-on it stays LOW for ~100–800ms, then goes HIGH and stays HIGH
Video output:
    VIC-II:
        pin 15 = view "SYNC/LUN explanation" in CRT for pin 15 (the next image after)
