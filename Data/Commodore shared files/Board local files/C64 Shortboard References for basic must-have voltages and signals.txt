Hardware      : Commodore 64

Below is my default troubleshooting guide for myself, so I do not forget. In most cases it covers the basics only, and it is for sure not a methodotical checklist that will check everything. I will add or change, once I repair more.

There is a slight change between the longboards and the shortboard. In the shortboard there is no "CAN" +5VDC rail, and all +5VDC comes from the external power supply.

Tooling requirements
--------------------
- Oscilloscope
- Multimeter

Voltages : Step 1
-----------------
Recommended reading for understanding C64 voltages:
https://refurbished-commodore.com/checking-c64-voltages

There are two different "rails" for +5VDC - one directly from the external power supply and one from the "CAN".

User port:
    +5VDC between pin 1+2 (one on each side of gap)
    9VAC between pin 10+11 (one on each side of gap)
CPU:
    +5VDC pin 6
VIC-II:
    +5VDC pin 40
    +5VDC pin 13

Also, traces or components could be broken elsewhere, so it is of course not bullet-proof, and you may need to check other places also, but above gives a good indication if the power rails are in good shape.


-----------------
Voltages : Step 2
-----------------
If any of the above voltages fails or looks off then check these.

Fuse:
    ---> THIS ONE MUST BE DONE WHEN C64 IS OFF!! <---
    In multimeter continuity mode then measure between the two ends - it should beep
Power switch:
    +5VDC between pin 5 and GND when C64 is off (it is expected voltage can be slightly higher due to no load)
    +5VDC between pin 4 and GND when C64 is on


-----------
Frequencies
-----------
CPU:
    pin 1 = 985 kHz: "Φ0" clock input
    pin 39 = 985 kHz: "Φ2" clock output from CPU
VIC-II:
    pin 17 = 985 kHz: "Φ0" clock output from VIC-II
    pin 21 = 17.72 MHz: ΦCOLOR clock input
    pin 22 = 7.88 MHz: ΦDOT clock input


-------
Signals
-------
Reset:
    CPU:
        pin 40 = at power-on it stays LOW for ~100–800ms, then goes HIGH and stays HIGH
Video output:
    VIC-II:
        pin 15 = view "SYNC/LUN explanation" in CRT for pin 15 (the next image after)
