Contribution for oscilloscope baseline readings
-----------------------------------------------
Revision date : 2025-November-10


If you want to contribute by measuring a new oscilloscope baseline for a specific board, then please read these definitions and rules, so you can understand what it implies for doing these measurements.

The intention with the baseline is actually NOT to thoroughly validate each and every IC is working as expected, but to get the computer to a minimum working "Basic" screen. This will both give a good success feeling for the most novice users (getting to this screen), but it will also do a simple validation that the IC's are at least not _completely_ broken, and at least not halting the system.

* Audience is a novice user, wanting to see "what is normal for this pin"
* Use 1V/DIV for 5V rails
* Use 2V/DIV for 12V rail
* Have CH1 marker (0V) placed at second last line in grid
* Always use "10X" probe
* When measuring a clear LOW or HIGH, use 1uS (by pressing "9" in numpad when using "ONC")
• Have trigger level set to ~1.5V
* Make sure to clear statistics before saving image
• Make sure to capture frequency for pins with frequency
• The image should show the overall trend; "what is it the most", so if it is mostly LOW, then it should show that and vice-versa. A signal pulsing should have a fairly high timing, to show the trend
* Make sure grid is clearly visible in the saved image
* Make sure waveform/graph is clearly visible in the saved image
* When measuring a pure LOW or HIGH signal, then do a capture in SINGLE mode to ensure it does never trigger the ~1.5V trigger level set. This is important, as many times the signal can look like it is only LOW or HIGH, but in reality it does pulse
* The saved image should not show "ghosting", colors, multi-channel readings or alike - look at the current images, and see what is acceptable and currently done
* Filename format must be (all CAPITALIZED): COMPONENT_PINNUMBER_REGION.png
	- example: U1_21_NTSC.png
	- example: U63_1_PAL.png
	- Recommended to use "Oscilloscope Network Capture", https://github.com/HovKlan-DH/Oscilloscope-Network-Capture
* Be sure the pin numbering on the saved files are correct, and do use a structured and methodical approach when taking measurements - we must be able to trust the result
* Visually doublecheck all images before submitting for inclusion!
* When committing to a baseline, then ALL IC's should be meassured for getting credits
* If you want to replace an already existing baseline, then please provide a reason why you think your baseline will be better than the existing
* Make sure to setup the system exactly as described in "Introduction to scope baseline measurements"

As a helper-tool you can use "Oscilloscope Network Capture" (ONC) from here, https://github.com/HovKlan-DH/Oscilloscope-Network-Capture (developed by me for this specific purpose).

Kind regards,
