Contribution for oscilloscope baseline imaging
----------------------------------------------
Revision date : 2025-October-15


If you want to contribute by measuring a new scope baseline for a specific board, then please read these definitions and rules, so you can understand what it implies for doing these measurements.

* Intention with the baseline is actually NOT to thoroughly validate each and every IC is working as expected, but to get the computer to a minimum working Basic screen. This will both give a good success feeling for the most novice users (getting to this screen), but it will also do a simple validation that the IC's are at least not _completely_ broken.
* Audience is the novice user wanting to see "what is normal for this pin"
* Use 1V/DIV for 5V rail
* Use 2V/DIV for 12V rail
* Always use "10X" probe
* Have CH1 marker (0V) placed at second last line in grid
• Have trigger level set to ~1.2V
* Make sure to clear statistics before saving image
• Make sure to capture frequency for pins with frequency
• The image should show the overall trend; "what is it the most", so if it is mostly LOW, then it should show that and vice-versa. A signal pulsing should have a fairly high timing, to show the trend
* Make sure grid is clearly visible in the saved image
* Make sure waveform/graph is clearly visible in the saved image
* When measuring a LOW or HIGH signal only, then do a SINGLE capture to ensure it does never trigger the trigger level set. This is important, as many times the signal can look like it is only LOW or HIGH, but in reality it does pulse
* When committing to a baseline, then ALL IC's should be meassured
* The saved image should not show "ghosting", colors, multiple channel readings or alike - look at the current images, and see what is acceptable... just "channel 1"
* Filename format must be (all CAPITALIZED): COMPONENT_PINNUMBER_REGION.png
	- example: U1_21_NTSC.png
	- example: U63_1_PAL.png
	- Recommended to use "Oscilloscope Network Capture", https://github.com/HovKlan-DH/Oscilloscope-Network-Capture
* If you want to replace an already existing baseline, then please provide a reason why you think your baseline will be better than the existing

Kind regards,
