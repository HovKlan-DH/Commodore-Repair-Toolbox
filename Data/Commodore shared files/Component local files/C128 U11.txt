Pin Explanation
---------------
1 	A15 		Address line 15
2 	A14			..
3 	A13			..
4 	A12			..
5 	A11			..
6 	A10 		..
7 	VICFIX 		Not used; connected to GND
8 	DMAACK		"Direct Memory Access Acknowledge" is not utilized and connected to +5VDC to keep it inactive
9 	AEC 		Indicates whether the CPU or the VIC-IIe has control over the system bus. High equals the CPU has control; Low equals the VIC or an external DMA controller has access to the bus
10 	R/W 		Read/Write indicates the direction of data transfer on the data bus. When HIGH, it is a read operation (CPU is reading data); when LOW, it is a write operation (CPU is writing data)
11 	GAME
12 	EXROM
13 	Z80 EN
14 	Z80 I/O
15 	64/128		HIGH sets C128 mode
16 	I/O SE
17 	ROMBANKHI
18 	ROMBANKLO
19 	VMA4
20 	VMA5
21 	BA 			"Bus Available" is an output signal to coordinate bus access between the CPU and VIC-IIe video chip. When LOW, the CPU must relinquish control of the bus, allowing the VIC-IIe to access memory for video data
22 	LORAM 		Input signal that, in conjunction with other control lines like HIRAM and CHAREN, determines the memory configuration. When LORAM is LOW, it enables the Basic ROM; when HIGH then RAM is selected
23 	HIRAM 		Input signal that, in conjunction with other control lines like LORAM and CHAREN, determines the memory configuration. When HIRAM is LOW, it enables the Kernal ROM; when HIGH then RAM is selected
24 	VSS 		Ground
25 	CHAREN		Input that determines whether the CPU accesses the "Character ROM" (U18) or the I/O area in the $D000â€“$DFFF address range. When CHAREN is LOW, the "Character ROM" is selected; when HIGH, the I/O area is selected
26 	VA14
27 	128/256		Distinguish between the standard 128KByte RAM configuration and an expanded 256KByte configuration
28 	N/C 		Not connected
29 	/SDEN		Chip select for dynamic RAM chips - LOW equals it is enabled
30 	/ROM L 		Enables access to the low area of ROMs - LOW equals it is enabled
31 	/ROM H 		Enables access to the high area of ROMs - LOW equals it is enabled
32 	CLRBNK
33 	/FROM 		Chip select for "Function ROM" (U36) - LOW equals it is enabled
34 	/ROM4 		Chip select for "Kernal & 40/80 columns; ROM 4" (U35) - LOW equals it is selected
35 	/ROM3 		Chip select for "Basic; ROM 3" (U34) - LOW equals it is selected
36 	/ROM2 		Chip select for "Basic; ROM 2" (U33) - LOW equals it is selected
37 	/ROM1 		Chip select for "Kernal & Basic; ROM 1" (U32) - LOW equals it is selected
38 	/IO CS
39 	DIR 		 Controls direction of data flow on the data bus. When active, it enables data to be driven onto the bus; when inactive, it sets the bus to a high-impedance state, allowing other devices to drive the bus
40 	DWE
41 	CASENB
42 	/VIC 		Chip select for the VIC-IIe chip - LOW equals it is selected
43 	/IO ACC 	Chip select for various I/O chips like CIA1 and CIA2, SID, and VDC - LOW equals it is selected
44 	GWE
45 	/COLRAM 	Chip select for color RAM (U19) - LOW equals it is selected
46 	/CHARROM 	Chip select for "Character; ROM" (U18) - LOW equals it is selected
47 	CLK 		Outputs system clock (/CAS signal); used to latch the column address into the DRAM chips
48 	VCC 		+5VDC
