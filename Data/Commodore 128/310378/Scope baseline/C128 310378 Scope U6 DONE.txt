Hardware      : Commodore 128 and 128D

Component     : U6, 8502, CPU

View the general introduction in the "Resources" tab; "Introduction to C128/C128D scope measurements".

Note that the below measurements are not bulletproof facts - they are concrete measurements done on my system
at a specific point in time, but there may be many reasons if you are not getting the exact same readings.
If you know my readings are wrong, then I would appreciate feedback so I can correct it, so future
users can benefit from it.

Similary, if you have the possibility to do the same measuremnts on a NTSC system, this would be great, so both
regions can be supported here.

37 D1 		  = pulsing
38 D0 		  = pulsing
39 R//W 	  = pulsing, but mostly HIGH
40 /RES 	  = HIGH (on power-on it should be LOW for approx ~100-500ms, and should then change to and remain HIGH)
