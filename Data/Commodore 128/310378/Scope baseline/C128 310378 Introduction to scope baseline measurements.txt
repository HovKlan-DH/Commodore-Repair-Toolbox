-----------------------------

The intention with this introduction and the following scope references, is to give a baseline with some concrete
and hands-on scope readings, on this very specific system, for comparison with your own measurements. It is meant as
a way for you to do a quick lookup of what a working system looks like, and it is also my own personal basic
troubleshooting guide for things to check, as I tend to forget this quickly :-)

This documentation and all its associated scope baseline measurements are done by the "Commodore Repair Toolbox"
developer, and you can connect with me via the "Feedback" tab.

The next logical step, after this introduction, is to open the "References for basic must-have voltages and signals"
documentation, also in the "Resources" tab. Also, several (IC) components will have scope baseline measurements you
can use when comparing with your own readings.

PAL
System used for all PAL measurements
------------------------------------
- Factory non-modified fully working C128 board 310378, with a Danish character ROM (325175-01)
- All original components (no modern replacements)
- In idle C128 Basic mode (cursor blinking) with no attachments connected at all, except audio/video cable (even no keyboard)
- Using new (bought) modern PSU
- Country (Denmark) has 230V/50Hz so it is PAL (not NTSC)

Scope measurements and good-to-know info
----------------------------------------
- Use scope to measure all DC voltage and LOW/HIGH signals
- Connect scope probe ground (GND) to expansion port chassis - not perfect at all, but OK to validate and with least short-circuit risks
    - Optimal reading is gained from connecting to closest GND and not the expansion port chassis
    - Optimal reading is gained by using scope GND pin-clip instead of the probe GND wire
    - Important: There are considerable more risk of short-circuit when actively handling two pins using both hands AND simultaneously looking at the scope - this is why I personally prefer always using the expansion port chassis as scope GND!
- Voltage measurement:
    - +5VDC rail: from ~4.6V to ~5.3V is most likely OK
    - +12VDC rail: from ~11.6V to ~12.4V is most likely OK
    - 9VAC rail: from ~8.6V to ~10.5V is most likely OK
    - Due to a lot of noise and old components the voltages measured should be "approx" values
- Hz measurement:
    - Should be fairly accurate - make sure scope volts/div setting and trigger point are proper set to get optimal reading
- Signal measurement (LOW/HIGH):
    - LOW equals below 0.8V
    - HIGH equals above 2V
    - "pulsing" in documentation means it pulses between LOW and HIGH
    - Investigate if dominant reading is in the range 0.9V to 2.2V, as ideally this is either a nice "near 0V" or "near 5V" signal plus some noise
- Trigger point can initially be set to ~2V, but expect to change it to get correct reading
- Probe set to "1x" attenuation, unless mentioned otherwise
- If reading is set as "N/A" it means the pin is not applicable, and the pin is most likely not connected to anything
- Before images are "printed" all values are cleared and then awaiting a couple of seconds for it to settle for new averages
- The reading can and will of course be very different when setup or load changes compared to the depicted setup in this documentation
- I cannot explain the reasoning behind why the reading is as-is, and I am just the "delivery man" of the data :-)
- You are highly encouraged to read "Sven's Techsite; Scope on the C64" from the "Resources" tab

AC voltage measurements
-----------------------
- Do not use scope to measure AC voltage
- For the 9VAC low voltage on Commodore boards there is no danger, but dealing with 120-240VAC can brick your scope!
- Use multimeter to measure AC voltage (used only to confirm 9VAC power rail)
