Best-practise before you power-on your system
---------------------------------------------
BEFORE you connect any power to your system, it is highly recommended to first measure voltages on the power supply (PSU) you plan to use. While modern replacement power supplies are likely to be safe to use, it is still recommended to verify before use.

Original Commodore power supplies can often fail (especially the first generation) in a way that delivers significant over-voltage on the voltage rails. This can damage several chips at once, bricking your system, and giving the all too typical "black screen".


-----------------------------------------------
Best-practise to keep your running system alive
-----------------------------------------------
If you have your system running, a few components will turn hot - some can even be so hot, that you cannot hold a finger to it. To reduce the stress from the heat, there are a couple of things you can do.

1) It is highly recommended to attach heatsinks for the core components. You do not need to heatsink all components - just the ones that are most expensive and get the hottest. Typically the glue-chips (logic IC) can be purchased cheaply or there are alternatives. There are of course also newer replacement IC's for the most, but they are typically more expensive than finding something on eBay.

These IC's should have heatsinks, as they are expensive and get hot:
- VIC-II
- SID
- CPU
- PLA
- 3 x ROM (Kernal, basic and Character)

Could have heatsinks, though they normally do not get that hot, but they are equally expensive:
- 2 x CIA

2) Furthermore, you are urged to scrap the builtin "RF shield" - sometimes it is a paperboard enclosure only, where other times it is a metal case. Just scrap it entirely, as it will actually keep the system warmer, and one can argue that its RF emissions does not matter in todays environment. Also, the cardboard tends to be one of the biggest "smelling points" of a vintage Commodore, as that old cardboard tends to have this kind of bad odors ;-)
