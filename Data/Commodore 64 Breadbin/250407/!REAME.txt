How to modify the labelling of components
-----------------------------------------

1) You find the tool "VGG Image Annotator" (VIA) in "\Tools\via-2.0.12\"
2) Drag the file "via.html" to your browser
3) Open one of the JSON files
4) VIA will now state that "File Not Found":
  4a) In the left-side file panel, select the filename
  4b) Click the right-side link, "browser's file seclector" and find the correct image file
  4c) It should now load the image and show all the labellings
5) Do your changes ...
6) Save the project to the same JSON file
7) Go to https://commodore-repair-toolbox.dk/convert-via-to-excel/
8) Upload the JSON file and download the Excel file it will provide
9) Copy/paste the data from the downloaded Excel file into the "Board" Excel file, in the worksheet "Component highlights"
  9a) Do note that the downloaded Excel does NOT provide the correct value for the "Schematic name" column!
  9b) You need to use the "Schematic name" from the worksheet "Board schematics" for that

That's it - check the result :-)
