# Classic Repair Toolbox

_Classic Repair Toolbox_ (or _CRT_ hence forward) is a cross-platform desktop application to assist hardware enthusiasts in diagnosing, troubleshooting, and repairing vintage computers and peripherals.

The project is a direct spin-off from an older project, _Commodore Repair Toolbox_ which now resides in a faint and distant memory only. The new _Classic_ project was realized as a complete rewrite, to be able to add natively support for **Linux** and **macOS**, but also to be able to support more hardware and not focus primarily on Commodore (Amstrad, ZX Spectrum and even different hardware types etc.).


## What can it do?

With _CRT_ you can easily view technical schematics, zoom, identify components, view chip pinouts, use interactive (KiCad) traces or do manual circuit tracing, study datasheets, view oscilloscope images, resources and various other information, helping you diagnosing and repairing old vintage hardware.

It is (for now) having Commodore computers with the most documented systems, but it also has an Amstrad and a ZX Spectrum board (more systems will come for sure), but it can support any kind of hardware, as you can add your own data - e.g. other computers, radios, DIY electronics or whatever else you can imagine. It probably works the best, if the hardware is "simple" and have good documentation available, like schematics, and if it is something you need to revisit multiple times - then you can add the needed information yourself, and use it for easy future reference.

## Requirements

- Operating systems supported:
  - **Windows 10** or newer (64-bit)
  - **macOS** on both **Apple Silicon** (arm64) and **Intel** (x64)
  - **Linux** (64-bit)
- Disk space needed: ~**2GB**

Note that the newest .NET LTS (Long-Term Support) is embedded in application, which means you do not need to have this installed. It also does mean that even if you have .NET installed on your computer, then it will still use the one embedded in application. Do note that it is the newest LTS at build time - it will _not_ get updated automatically and will stay as-is, until a newer version of _CRT_ is released.


## Installation and usage

Download the newest normal (non-BETA) _CRT_ version from [Releases](https://github.com/HovKlan-DH/Classic-Repair-Toolbox/releases), and install it. The installation folder cannot be chosen by the user and is determined by the installation process. In the `Configuration` tab you can open the folder and see where the configuration and data files are stored.

If you want the actual data stored elsewhere than default, then this can be changed via a commandline parameter, view [Commandline parameters](https://github.com/HovKlan-DH/Classic-Repair-Toolbox/wiki/Commandline-parameters).

Depending on your configuration settings, then _CRT_ will check for newer data at application launch. It is recommended to have this enabled, as there will come many updates over time.

When a new version is released it will (per default, but can be configured) be shown to you in the application, and you can update directly from within the application.

## Help wanted

I will keep adding and enhancing data, but if this is only me providing data, then it will take many years before this will reach a "premium level" - **if ever** 😁 So, I really do hope that the community will contribute, so it quickly can become a good source of information.

Data contribution can be almost anything - tiny and trivial updates (spelling mistakes, wrong or missing technical values or alike) or it can be huge new boards, but I really would like to get a massive amount of **quality** data, for the benefit of everyone using this. The goal is that it should have (most) relevant data in one place, so it would not be required to go and lookup for other data sources, but of course it also needs to be balanced a little, not overwelming with too much data 🤔

Contributing data is very easy - just go to the "Contribute" tab, select the component you want to edit and send your update - that's it.

You can help specifically with these topics:
- Do you have higher-quality images of the used schematics?
- Do you have (better) datasheets or pinouts for any of the components?
- Do you see missing components in either the component list or as a highlight?
- Can you improve any data or fill in more technical details anywhere?
