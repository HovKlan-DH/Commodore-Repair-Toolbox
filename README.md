# PoC for Commodore Repair Toolbox

**Proof-of-Concept** and only for **internal use**!

Not sure project will ever be realized, as core functionalities must be running before any conclusion can be made - let's see...

Also, no need to bookmark or follow this project, as its **GitLab repository will get deleted** once a conclusion has been made. Then it will either be migrated to [Commodore Repair Toolbox GitLab](https://github.com/HovKlan-DH/Commodore-Retro-Toolbox) or simply just deleted, as there is no more use for it.
