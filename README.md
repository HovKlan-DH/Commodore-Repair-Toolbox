# Commodore Repair Toolbox

This is the official home page for _Commodore Repair Toolbox_ (CRT) - a helper tool for repairing vintage hardware.


**What is it?**

With _CRT_ you can view or add schematics, labels, pinouts, datasheets, ressources and various other information, for helping diagnosing and repairing old and vintage hardware. It is primarily dedicated to Commodore, but it does support any kind of hardware - e.g. other computers, radios, DIY electronics or whatever else you can imagine. It probably works the best, if the hardware is "simnple" and have good documentation available, where you then can add this information yourself and then use for easy referene for future projects.


**How can you help?**

I really would appreciate that some experienced persons would take a look, and let me know of factual errors or things I missed.
You can create a new [Issue]([url](https://github.com/HovKlan-DH/Commodore-Repair-Toolbox/issues)) in the project or write an email to **crt** at **mailscan** dot **dk**


**TODO**
- Fix clicking in thumbnail cannot activate image, if clicked at component location
- Add data for Commodore 64 (Breadbin) schematics 250407 and 250425
- Add data for Commodore 64C schematics 250466
- Show asterisk (*) in thumbnail label when chosen component is visible in image
- Label in thumnail should not float above image (show label first, then image)
- Pack EXE into one executuable file only
- Populate "Changelog" tab
- Setup a "Donate" link


**Roadmap/ideas** (potential only - no guarantee at all!)
- Have people download and upload new schematics or updates directly from tool


**Inspiration for creating this project?**

I have been repairing Commodore 64 and C128 for some years, and I am by far still a "noob" for this. I kind of forget where and what to check, so I find it difficult to find again all the relevant ressources and schematics to check. I did often refer to the "Mainboards" section of [My Old Computer]([url](https://myoldcomputer.nl/technical-info/mainboards/)), and I noticed that Jeroen did have a prototype of an aapplication named "Repair Help", and it did have the easy layout I was looking for. However, it was never finalized, so I took upon me to create something similar, and a couple of years later I did come up with a very similar looking application, also utilizing a lot of data directly from [My Old Computer]([url](https://myoldcomputer.nl/)) (with permission from Jeroen, of course).
