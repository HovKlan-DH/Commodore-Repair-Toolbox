    // WorkDoneItems/Photos/Files sub-lists and its component checklists, and shows a read-only
    // preview of where the entry's marked area sits on its schematic.
    //
    // Two ways in, both of which must be called before ShowDialog:
    //   Initialize            - a SAVED entry, from clicking its pill on the Schematics tab (see
    //                           TabSchematics.Worklog.cs's OnWorklogEntryPillPointerPressed) or on
    //                           the Workbooks tab's board pane.
    //   InitializeForNewEntry - a NEW entry, from "Add worklog" after an area is drawn. It used to
    //                           open a small "New fault" quick card asking for a subset of these
    //                           same fields; that card is gone and this window is the whole step.
    //
    // Works on a private working copy of the WorklogEntryRecord (thisEntry) built from the caller's
    // record. For a saved entry, sub-list changes write through immediately (PersistEntrySilently)
    // and Save commits the direct fields via WorklogManager.UpdateEntry. For a NEW one nothing
    // reaches disk until Save, which writes the whole record through WorklogManager.AddEntryRecord -
    // see thisIsDraftEntry. Cancel/closing discards the working copy either way.
    //

    // see the ATTACHMENTS header further down for which axes they differ on and why the ordering

        //            persist failed. Otherwise the folder holds bytes entries.json never mentions.
        //   Edit   - persist the record BEFORE swapping the file, because the swap deletes what it
        //            replaces. The other order left entries.json naming a file already deleted,
        //            and Cancel then discarded the working copy - the row was permanently broken
        //            with no way back to the original.

        //            pointing at nothing when the save fails.
        //
        // These were written out twice, and had already begun to drift: the file-side copies
