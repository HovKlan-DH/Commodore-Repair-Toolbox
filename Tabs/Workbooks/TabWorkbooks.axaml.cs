    // THE WORKBOOKS TAB - concept "C; Worklog tab" from the mockup, now fully functional.
    //
    // FILE MAP - this class is split across:
    //   TabWorkbooks.axaml.cs        (this file) construction, Main wiring, the splitters and their
    //                                persistence, the left-hand workbook list and its cards, and
    //                                the top-line above the board/entry split
    //   TabWorkbooks.BoardPreviews.cs the board pane and the entry list beside it - schematic
    //                                previews, entry badges, schematic selection, entry detail
    //                                cards, and the editor a badge opens
    //
    // What IS real:
    //   - the left panel, listing the workbooks WorklogManager holds for the selected board,
    //     rebuilt by RefreshWorkbooks;
    //   - clicking a card ACTIVATES that workbook app-wide (see SelectWorkbook): the choice is
    //     persisted to UserSettings.ActiveWorkbookIdByBoard and the worklog bar, "Show worklogs"
    //     and "Add worklog" all follow it. The tab does not switch away - the top-line and the
    //     board pane update in place;
    //   - the board pane (TabWorkbooks.BoardPreviews.cs): every schematic image with entries in the
    //     ACTIVE workbook, each entry drawn as the Schematics tab draws it - a dashed bounds
    //     rectangle plus an anchored badge where "show marked area" is on, a corner-parked badge
    //     where it is not;
    //   - clicking a badge opens the SAME WorklogEntryEditorWindow the Schematics tab opens,
    //     component-scope checklist included;
    //   - clicking elsewhere on a preview selects that schematic and switches the entry list on the
    //     right to it, one detail card per entry;
    //   - the top-line's second line shows the selected workbook's Note (the whole line collapsed
    //     when blank), and, right-aligned against both lines, "Edit workbook"/"Delete workbook"
    //     actions for it (OnEditWorkbookClick/OnDeleteWorkbookClick, below). Edit reopens
    //     CreateWorkbookWindow via InitializeForEdit - the SAME modal "Create new workbook" uses,
    //     pre-filled, its submit button relabelled "Update workbook" - so title/note editing has
    //     exactly one implementation rather than a second dialog to keep in sync. Delete confirms
    //     via DeleteWorkbookWindow (no minimize button, and Enter cancels rather than confirms -
    //     deleting is a click on the button, never a reflexive keypress), then
    //     WorklogManager.DeleteWorkbook removes the workbook's whole folder; the refresh that
    //     follows lands on the board's next workbook automatically, via the same
    //     ResolveActiveWorkbook stale-id fallback that already handles a workbook deleted by hand.
    //
    //   - the "Find a previous repair" box filters this whole tab as you type
    //     (OnFindRepairTextChanged -> RefreshWorkbooks): the workbook list, the board pane and the
    //     entry list all narrow to what matched, and the matched runs are highlighted wherever they
    //     are drawn. The query grammar and the fields it searches are Handlers/Data's own
    //     WorklogSearchQuery and WorklogSearchIndex - see their headers. RefreshWorkbooks re-reads
    //     the box itself rather than trusting a cached copy, so the filter survives every other
    //     refresh trigger too.
    //
    // Main.RefreshWorklogBar calls RefreshWorkbooks, so the list, the selected card, the top-line
    // and the board pane all follow a board change and any workbook edit through the one funnel the
    // rest of the worklog feature already refreshes through. The board pane has a second, narrower
    // entry point for when the component highlight cache changes - see
    // RefreshBoardPreviewsForCurrentSelection.
    //
    // Visibility is not decided here: Main.axaml.cs's ApplyWorklogBarVisibility shows and hides the
    // tab along with the worklog bar, both driven by "Enable Worklog" in Configuration.
