# Turns the Cobertura XML that "dotnet test --collect:XPlat Code Coverage" writes into a
# human-readable job summary, and prints the same figures to the log.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. .claude/CLAUDE.md deliberately refuses to record a coverage percentage in any
# document, because a figure written down goes stale silently and is then quoted as fact. That is
# exactly what happened: the working assumption was "about 25%" when the real overall figure was
# 40.2% and 25% was the UI-only number. A figure the pipeline recomputes on every push cannot go
# stale, which is the point of doing it here rather than in a README.
#
# It deliberately does NOT fail the build on a threshold. Coverage is a trend to watch, not a gate,
# and a floor set while the suite is still growing either blocks unrelated work or is set so low it
# means nothing. If a gate is wanted later, that is a separate and deliberate decision.
#
# Usage: coverage-summary.sh <path-to-coverage.cobertura.xml>

# The totals live in attributes on the root <coverage> element, so a grep is enough and this

# The attributes are read from THAT ELEMENT ONLY, not from the file at large. Cobertura writers
# put line-rate/branch-rate on <package> and <class> too, and coverlet has emitted
# lines-covered/lines-valid on <package> as well - so a whole-file "grep | head -1" is right only
# as long as the root element happens to come first in document order. If it ever does not (a
# merged multi-assembly report, a reordered writer), that grep would silently report ONE PACKAGE's
# numbers as the project total: no error, just a wrong figure quoted as fact, which is the exact
# failure this script exists to prevent. So isolate the root element once, then read from it.
